## v0.0.0 - 02/09/20
* transferred [ck2 syntax](https://atom.io/packages/language-crusader-kings--i-i) by howlinweed to ck3 as basic starting point
* much of the syntax from ck2 is the same as ck3, so without any edits this partially works as is. but some tweaking will be needed
* currently i plan to make tweaks as i go and push updates as appropriate
* anyone else is welcome to contribute
